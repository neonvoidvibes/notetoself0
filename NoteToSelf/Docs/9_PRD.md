---

## 6. UI/UX and Design Requirements

**Design Principles:**

- **Minimalism:**
    - A clean, flat design with ample whitespace.
- **Speed & Clarity:**
    - Simple navigation with one-tap interactions.
- **Elegant Aesthetics:**
    - Use a dark theme by default, large legible typography, subtle animations, and refined transitions.
- **Separated Visual Components:**
    - **Important:** All visual elements (buttons, cards, icons, animations, color schemes) must be defined in a dedicated Swift UI library file. This file will serve as the single source of truth for all UI elements, ensuring a strict separation of concerns and rapid iteration.

## 7. Technical Architecture & Stack

### 7.1 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (for modern, declarative UI design)
- **Local Storage:** Core Data (for fast, offline journaling)
- **LLM API:** OpenAI API, model “GPT-4o” (for early updated version)
- **Optional Cloud Sync:** iCloud (for secure, optional data backup)

### 7.2 Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:**
    - Use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to separate UI from business logic and data handling.
- **Modularization:**
    - Create a dedicated module (or framework) for UI components. All visual elements, animations, styling and layout settings will reside in one Swift file (or a clearly defined set of files within a UI module) to allow rapid UI updates without touching business logic.
- **Best Practices:**
    - Follow SOLID principles.
    - Ensure code reusability through protocols, extensions, and dependency injection.
    - Write unit and UI tests to guarantee reliability and maintainability.

## 8. UI Components Library (Swift File)

**Purpose:**

Centralize all visual elements (colors, typography, icons, buttons, animations, layout settings) into one library file. This file will be imported across all views, ensuring a consistent look and rapid iteration.

**Example Structure (Pseudocode):**

```swift
// UIStyles.swift

import SwiftUI

struct UIStyles {
    // MARK: - Colors
    static let primaryColor = Color("PrimaryColor") // defined in Assets.xcassets
    static let backgroundColor = Color("BackgroundColor")
    static let accentColor = Color("AccentColor")

    // MARK: - Typography
    static let headingFont = Font.system(size: 28, weight: .bold, design: .default)
    static let bodyFont = Font.system(size: 18, weight: .regular, design: .default)

    // MARK: - Buttons
    static func primaryButtonStyle() -> some ButtonStyle {
        return PrimaryButtonStyle()
    }

    // MARK: - Animations & Transitions
    static let smoothTransition = AnyTransition.opacity.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3))

    // Additional visual elements such as card styles, icon sets, etc.
}

// Example of a custom button style
struct PrimaryButtonStyle: ButtonStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.label
            .font(UIStyles.bodyFont)
            .padding()
            .background(UIStyles.accentColor)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(8)
            .scaleEffect(configuration.isPressed ? 0.95 : 1.0)
    }
}

```

*Note:* This file is the single source for all visual configurations, ensuring any UI change is isolated from the core app logic.
