# Name Suggestion

"Note to Self"— an excellent app name for a micro journal! It's:

- Simple and uses real words
- Not generic - it's distinctive yet instantly understandable
- Not a dual word combination (it's a common phrase)
- Perfectly captures the essence of what micro journaling is about - quick personal notes to yourself

The name has a natural, conversational quality that feels approachable and unpretentious. It also implies the personal, private nature of journaling without being overly precious about it.
