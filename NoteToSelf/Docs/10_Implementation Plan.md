# Document 10. Implementation Plan

Below is the detailed, step‑by‑step implementation plan for the first version release of “Note to Self.” Each step and sub‑step is clearly marked with [human engineer] or [ai coder] and includes checkboxes for tracking progress, including backend preparations for GPT‑4o integration and theme options.

---

### 1. Project Setup & Environment Configuration

- [x]  **[human engineer]** Create a new iOS project in Xcode:
    - Launch Xcode, select “File > New > Project” using the “App” template.
    - Name the project “Note to Self,” set the interface to SwiftUI and the language to Swift.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Configure project settings:
    - Set the Bundle Identifier and deployment target (e.g., iOS 16+).
    - Review and update the Info.plist as needed.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Organize the project structure by creating folders/groups for:
    - Views, Models, ViewModels, and UIComponents.

---

### 2. Develop the UI Components Library

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Create a new Swift file named `UIStyles.swift` in the UIComponents folder.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Implement common visual elements:
    - Colors, typography, button styles, and animations/transitions.
    - Reference the provided pseudocode for guidance.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the UI library by importing it into a simple view and verify global style updates.

---

### 3. Build the Onboarding Flow

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Create `OnboardingView` in SwiftUI:
    - Design a clean welcome screen with minimal text (e.g., “Capture your day in under 30 seconds”) and a “Get Started” button.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Implement navigation:
    - Set up a NavigationStack (or NavigationView) so that tapping “Get Started” transitions to the Main Journal Interface.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the onboarding flow in the Simulator:
    - Verify the “Get Started” button navigates correctly.

---

### 4. Implement the Core Journal Entry Feature

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Create `JournalEntryView` for fast text input and mood selection:
    - Ensure the entry field is large, tap‑friendly, and follows the minimalist design.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Set up the Core Data stack:
    - Create a `JournalEntry` model with attributes like text, mood, and timestamp.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the journal entry flow:
    - Run the app and add several entries.
    - Verify that entries are saved locally via Core Data.

---

### 5. Develop the Minimalist Timeline View

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Build `TimelineView`:
    - Display journal entries as card‑based, scrollable views using a ScrollView or List.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Integrate Core Data fetch requests:
    - Ensure the view pulls and displays the saved JournalEntry items.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the timeline display:
    - Verify that entries appear in the correct order and tap/swipe interactions work.

---

### 6. Implement Daily Streak & Habit Tracking

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Add a visual progress indicator to the TimelineView:
    - Implement a horizontal progress bar or calendar dot system that updates based on daily entries.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Develop streak calculation logic in the ViewModel:
    - Write functions to calculate and update daily streaks from entry timestamps.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the streak feature:
    - Simulate multiple days (or adjust device dates) and confirm the indicator updates correctly.

---

### 7. Ensure a No-Login & Offline-First Experience

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Configure the app to use Core Data exclusively for storage:
    - Ensure all data is saved locally with no sign‑up requirements.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test offline functionality:
    - Run the app with the network turned off and verify that journal entries and streaks work as expected.

---

### 8. Integrate Navigation & Basic Settings

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Implement basic navigation elements:
    - Add left‑hand side back navigation (chevron icon) and right‑hand side settings icon.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Create `SettingsView`:
    - At minimum, include a dark/light mode toggle.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test navigation:
    - Confirm smooth transitions between the main interface and settings.

---

### 8.5 Backend Preparations & Testing

- **GPT‑4o LLM Integration:**
    - [ ]  **[ai coder]** Set up the backend integration for OpenAI GPT‑4o:
        - Create a configuration file that securely loads the OpenAI API key from environment variables.
        - Implement a test function that calls GPT‑4o and logs the response.
    - [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the GPT‑4o integration:
        - Verify via logs or a temporary debug view that the API call works correctly.
- **Theme Options:**
    - [ ]  **[ai coder]** Implement dynamic theme options in `UIStyles.swift`:
        - Add theme variables (e.g., dark mode, light mode, and custom accent colors) and expose a function to switch themes.
    - [ ]  **[human engineer]** Test the theme options:
        - Verify that switching themes via the SettingsView toggle updates the app’s UI across all views.
        - Confirm that theme changes persist as expected.

---

### 9. Integration, Testing, & Quality Assurance

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Write unit tests for:
    - Core Data operations (saving/fetching entries).
    - Streak calculation logic.
- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Develop UI tests:
    - Simulate key user interactions (onboarding, journal entry, timeline navigation).
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Perform manual testing:
    - Run the app in the Simulator and on physical devices.
    - Verify performance, smooth animations, and offline functionality.

---

### 10. Final Polishing & Code Review

- [ ]  **[ai coder]** Clean up code:
    - Ensure proper comments, naming conventions, and adherence to the MVVM pattern and SOLID principles.
    - Confirm that the UI library (`UIStyles.swift`) is the single source for visual configurations.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Conduct peer code review and regression testing:
    - Address any feedback and re-test the app to ensure no issues remain.

---

### 11. App Store Preparation & Submission

- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Prepare app metadata:
    - Draft the app description, keywords (e.g., journal, diary, mood tracker), screenshots, and app icon.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Archive the app:
    - In Xcode, use “Product > Archive” and validate the build in the Organizer.
- [ ]  **[human engineer]** Submit the app via App Store Connect:
    - Upload the build, fill in all required metadata, and submit for review.
    - Monitor the submission status and address any feedback from Apple.

By following these checklisted steps—with clear responsibilities for both [ai coder] and [human engineer]—the development team will be well-equipped to build, test, and launch the first version of “Note to Self,” including proper backend integration for GPT‑4o and dynamic theme options.
